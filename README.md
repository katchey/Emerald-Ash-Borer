The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, is a type of beetle originally from Asia. It lays its eggs in the cracks of ash tree bark. After hatching, the larvae live under the bark, eating away at the tree for one to two years before turning into adult beetles. In Asia, it doesn't usually cause big problems for trees. But when it gets into new places like Europe and North America, it becomes a big issue because it harms the native ash trees, which haven't evolved resistance to this pest.

The insect was first discovered in Canton, Michigan (near Detroit), in 2002, though it may have been in the U.S. since the late 1980s. It may have been brought to the U.S. hidden in shipping materials like packing crates. In its natural habitat, there are typically factors that keep its population in check, such as resistant trees, predators, and parasitoid wasps. However, when it enters new environments lacking these natural controls, its numbers can rapidly increase, causing significant damage.
Once it establishes itself in an area, most ash trees there will perish within approximately 10 years if no action is taken to manage it. Nearly every type of ash tree in North America is vulnerable to this insect, with green ash and black ash being most susceptible. Although white ash displays some resistance, it often succumbs once other species are affected. Blue ash, on the other hand, poses a greater challenge for the insect due to its high tannin content, rendering its leaves unappealing. Nevertheless, the emerald ash borer poses a threat to the entire North American genus Fraxinus, having already decimated millions of trees and endangering the vast majority of the 8.7 billion ash trees across the continent.
The burden of managing these trees often falls on homeowners or local authorities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once can be financially prohibitive. Therefore, a common approach is to slow down the rate of tree mortality by removing already infested trees and treating others with insecticides. This buys time for local governments to plan, remove, and replace affected trees gradually, ultimately saving money. For instance, treating the trees over a decade would cost about $10.7 billion in urban areas across 25 states, whereas replacing them all at once would require approximately $25 billion (with some estimates reaching as high as $60 billion). Some urban areas, like Minneapolis, have a significant proportion of their urban forest comprised of ash trees, making up slightly over 20% of the total. In Boise, 14% of the managed street trees are ash trees. No new ash trees are being planted in Boise, even though the emerald ash borer has not been detected here yet. It will probably arrive at some point - it skipped over Idaho and was detected in Portland already.
